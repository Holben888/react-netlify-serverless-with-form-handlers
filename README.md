> A demo of reading form data with serverside validation. Made possible by React and Netlify Serverless 🔹 

Source code from [Jason Lengstorf's eggheadio course](https://egghead.io/courses/create-a-typescript-powered-serverless-react-application-cf0acfbf) on Netlify serverless with TS + React.

### 🧑‍💻 [Try it out!](react-netlify-serverless.netlify.app)

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

You'll need a copy of Netlify's CLI to run this project locally. I'd suggest installing this as a global dependency, and starting the dev server like so:

```sh
npm i -g netlify-cli
ntl dev
```

You should see the project at http://localhost:8888 🚀
